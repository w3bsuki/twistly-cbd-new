    question: "How can CBD help with stress and anxiety?",
    answer: "CBD interacts with the body's endocannabinoid system, which plays a role in regulating stress, mood, and anxiety. Research suggests CBD may help reduce anxiety by affecting serotonin receptors in the brain. Many users report feeling calmer and more relaxed after taking CBD products, with reduced symptoms of stress without the sedative effects of traditional anti-anxiety medications."

    question: "What's the difference between full-spectrum and broad-spectrum CBD?",
    answer: "Full-spectrum CBD contains all cannabinoids naturally found in the cannabis plant, including trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%). This creates an 'entourage effect' where compounds work together for enhanced benefits. Broad-spectrum CBD contains multiple cannabinoids but has THC completely removed, making it ideal for those who want benefits without any THC. CBD isolate is the purest form, containing only CBD with all other compounds removed."

    question: "How long does it take to feel the effects of CBD?",
    answer: "The onset time varies based on the consumption method. Sublingual products (oils, tinctures) typically take effect in 15-30 minutes as they're absorbed directly into the bloodstream. Edibles and capsules may take 1-2 hours as they pass through the digestive system first. Topicals work within 15-20 minutes where applied. Effects generally last 4-6 hours, though this varies by individual metabolism, dosage, and product potency."

    question: "Can CBD interact with medications I'm currently taking?",
    answer: "Yes, CBD can interact with certain medications by affecting the cytochrome P450 enzyme system responsible for metabolizing many drugs. This interaction is similar to that of grapefruit. If your medication has a grapefruit warning, consult with a healthcare provider before using CBD. Common medications that may interact include blood thinners, antiepileptics, and certain antidepressants."

    question: "Is CBD legal and will it show up on a drug test?",
    answer: "Hemp-derived CBD containing less than 0.3% THC is federally legal in the United States under the 2018 Farm Bill, though state laws vary. Standard drug tests typically screen for THC metabolites, not CBD. While pure CBD isolate shouldn't trigger a positive result, full-spectrum products contain trace amounts of THC that could potentially accumulate and trigger a positive result with regular, high-dose use."

    question: "What's the best way to determine my ideal CBD dosage?",
    answer: "Start with a low dose (5-10mg) and gradually increase until you achieve desired effects ('start low, go slow'). Track your response in a journal noting dosage, time, and effects. Consider factors like body weight, metabolism, and condition severity. For example, minor discomfort might require 10-15mg while severe conditions might need 50mg+. Professional guidance is recommended, especially for specific health conditions."

  {
    question: "Are there any side effects associated with CBD use?",
    answer: "CBD is generally well-tolerated, but some users report mild side effects including dry mouth, drowsiness, slight drop in blood pressure, and changes in appetite or weight. Digestive discomfort can occur, particularly with higher doses. These effects are typically temporary and resolve when reducing dosage. CBD's side effect profile is considered milder than many conventional medications used for similar conditions."

  {
    question: "How should I store my CBD products?",
    answer: "Store CBD products in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, which can degrade cannabinoids. Most products don't require refrigeration but keeping oils refrigerated may extend shelf life. Always keep containers tightly sealed to prevent air exposure. Check product labels for specific storage instructions and expiration dates, as most CBD products maintain potency for 1-2 years when properly stored."
